## Music Generation Using Audio
Overview
This project explores the generation of music using AI techniques applied to audio data. By analyzing audio features, understanding patterns, and applying deep learning models, the system generates new music compositions. The project integrates audio processing tools and machine learning frameworks to create a seamless pipeline for music generation.

## Features
Audio Analysis: Extracts features like pitch, tempo, rhythm, and timbre from input audio.
Music Generation: Synthesizes new compositions based on the learned patterns from existing music.
Genre Adaptability: Supports generation in various music styles (e.g., classical, jazz, EDM).
Custom Inputs: Allows users to input audio or MIDI files as inspiration.
Export Options: Outputs generated music as audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3) or MIDI sequences.
